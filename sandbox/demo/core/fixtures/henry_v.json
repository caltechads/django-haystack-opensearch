And while thou liv'st, dear Kate, take a fellow of\nplain and uncoined constancy, for he perforce must\ndo thee right because he hath not the gift to woo in\nother places. For these fellows of infinite tongue,\nthat can rhyme themselves into ladies' favors, they\ndo always reason themselves out again. What? A\nspeaker is but a prater, a rhyme is but a ballad, a\ngood leg will fall, a straight back will stoop, a black\nbeard will turn white, a curled pate will grow bald,\na fair face will wither, a full eye will wax hollow, but\na good heart, Kate, is the sun and the moon, or\nrather the sun and not the moon, for it shines bright\nand never changes but keeps his course truly. If\nthou would have such a one, take me. And take me,\ntake a soldier. Take a soldier, take a king. And what\nsay'st thou then to my love? Speak, my fair, and\nfairly, I pray thee.",
