I am boy to them all three, but all they\nthree, though they would serve me, could not be\nman to me. For indeed three such antics do not\namount to a man: for Bardolph, he is white-livered\nand red-faced, by the means whereof he faces it out\nbut fights not; for Pistol, he hath a killing tongue\nand a quiet sword, by the means whereof he breaks\nwords and keeps whole weapons; for Nym, he hath\nheard that men of few words are the best men, and\ntherefore he scorns to say his prayers, lest he should\nbe thought a coward, but his few bad words are\nmatched with as few good deeds, for he never broke\nany man's head but his own, and that was against a\npost when he was drunk. They will steal anything\nand call it purchase. Bardolph stole a lute case, bore\nit twelve leagues, and sold it for three halfpence.\nNym and Bardolph are sworn brothers in filching,\nand in Calais they stole a fire shovel.

They\nwould have me as familiar with men's pockets as\ntheir gloves or their handkerchers, which makes\nmuch against my manhood, if I should take from\nanother's pocket to put into mine, for it is plain\npocketing up of wrongs.

I pray you, what thinks he of our\nestate?\nKING HENRY  Even as men wracked upon a sand, that\nlook to be washed off the next tide.\nBATES  He hath not told his thought to the King?\nKING HENRY  No. Nor it is not meet he should, for,\nthough I speak it to you, I think the King is but a\nman as I am. The violet smells to him as it doth to\nme. The element shows to him as it doth to me. All\nhis senses have but human conditions. His ceremonies\nlaid by, in his nakedness he appears but a man,\nand though his affections are higher mounted than\nours, yet when they stoop, they stoop with the like\nwing. Therefore, when he sees reason of fears as we\ndo, his fears, out of doubt, be of the same relish as\nours are. Yet, in reason, no man should possess him\nwith any appearance of fear, lest he, by showing it,\nshould dishearten his army.\nBATES  He may show what outward courage he will,\nbut I believe, as cold a night as 'tis, he could wish\nhimself in Thames up to the neck; and so I would\nhe were, and I by him, at all adventures, so we were\nquit here.\nKING HENRY  By my troth, I will speak my conscience\nof the King. I think he would not wish himself\nanywhere but where he is.\nBATES  Then I would he were here alone; so should he\nbe sure to be ransomed, and a many poor men's\nlives saved.\nKING HENRY  I dare say you love him not so ill to wish\nhim here alone, howsoever you speak this to feel\nother men's minds. Methinks I could not die anywhere\nso contented as in the King's company, his\ncause being just and his quarrel honorable.\nWILLIAMS  That's more than we know.\nBATES  Ay, or more than we should seek after, for we\nknow enough if we know we are the King's subjects.\nIf his cause be wrong, our obedience to the\nKing wipes the crime of it out of us.\nWILLIAMS  But if the cause be not good, the King\nhimself hath a heavy reckoning to make, when all\nthose legs and arms and heads, chopped off in a\nbattle, shall join together at the latter day, and cry\nall \"We died at such a place,\" some swearing, some\ncrying for a surgeon, some upon their wives left\npoor behind them, some upon the debts they owe,\nsome upon their children rawly left. I am afeard\nthere are few die well that die in a battle, for how\ncan they charitably dispose of anything when blood\nis their argument? Now, if these men do not die\nwell, it will be a black matter for the king that led\nthem to it, who to disobey were against all proportion\nof subjection.\nKING HENRY  So, if a son that is by his father sent about\nmerchandise do sinfully miscarry upon the sea,\nthe imputation of his wickedness, by your rule,\nshould be imposed upon his father that sent him.\nOr if a servant, under his master's command transporting\na sum of money, be assailed by robbers and\ndie in many irreconciled iniquities, you may call the\nbusiness of the master the author of the servant's\ndamnation. But this is not so. The King is not bound\nto answer the particular endings of his soldiers, the\nfather of his son, nor the master of his servant, for\nthey purpose not their death when they purpose\ntheir services. Besides, there is no king, be his cause\nnever so spotless, if it come to the arbitrament of\nswords, can try it out with all unspotted soldiers.\nSome, peradventure, have on them the guilt of\npremeditated and contrived murder; some, of beguiling\nvirgins with the broken seals of perjury;\nsome, making the wars their bulwark, that have\nbefore gored the gentle bosom of peace with pillage\nand robbery. Now, if these men have defeated the\nlaw and outrun native punishment, though they can\noutstrip men, they have no wings to fly from God.\nWar is His beadle, war is His vengeance, so that here\nmen are punished for before-breach of the King's\nlaws in now the King's quarrel. Where they feared\nthe death, they have borne life away; and where they\nwould be safe, they perish. Then, if they die unprovided,\nno more is the King guilty of their damnation\nthan he was before guilty of those impieties for the\nwhich they are now visited. Every subject's duty is\nthe King's, but every subject's soul is his own.\nTherefore should every soldier in the wars do as\nevery sick man in his bed: wash every mote out of\nhis conscience. And, dying so, death is to him\nadvantage; or not dying, the time was blessedly lost\nwherein such preparation was gained. And in him\nthat escapes, it were not sin to think that, making\nGod so free an offer, He let him outlive that day to\nsee His greatness and to teach others how they\nshould prepare.\nWILLIAMS  'Tis certain, every man that dies ill, the ill\nupon his own head; the King is not to answer it.\nBATES  I do not desire he should answer for me, and yet\nI determine to fight lustily for him.\nKING HENRY  I myself heard the King say he would not\nbe ransomed.\nWILLIAMS  Ay, he said so to make us fight cheerfully,\nbut when our throats are cut, he may be ransomed\nand we ne'er the wiser.\nKING HENRY  If I live to see it, I will never trust his\nword after.\nWILLIAMS  You pay him then. That's a perilous shot out\nof an elder gun, that a poor and a private displeasure\ncan do against a monarch. You may as well go\nabout to turn the sun to ice with fanning in his face\nwith a peacock's feather. You'll \"never trust his\nword after.\" Come, 'tis a foolish saying.\nKING HENRY  Your reproof is something too round. I\nshould be angry with you if the time were\nconvenient.\nWILLIAMS  Let it be a quarrel between us, if you live.\nKING HENRY  I embrace it.\nWILLIAMS  How shall I know thee again?\nKING HENRY  Give me any gage of thine, and I will wear\nit in my bonnet. Then, if ever thou dar'st acknowledge\nit, I will make it my quarrel.\nWILLIAMS  Here's my glove. Give me another of thine.\nKING HENRY  There.\t[They exchange gloves.]\nWILLIAMS  This will I also wear in my cap. If ever thou\ncome to me and say, after tomorrow, \"This is my\nglove,\" by this hand I will take thee a box on the\near.\nKING HENRY  If ever I live to see it, I will challenge it.\nWILLIAMS  Thou dar'st as well be hanged.\nKING HENRY  Well, I will do it, though I take thee in the\nKing's company.\nWILLIAMS  Keep thy word. Fare thee well.\nBATES  Be friends, you English fools, be friends. We\nhave French quarrels enough, if you could tell how\nto reckon.\nKING HENRY  Indeed, the French may lay twenty\nFrench crowns to one they will beat us, for they\nbear them on their shoulders. But it is no English\ntreason to cut French crowns, and tomorrow the\nKing himself will be a clipper.\nUpon the King! Let us our lives, our souls, our\ndebts, our careful wives, our children, and our sins,\nlay on the King!\nWe must bear all. O hard condition,\nTwin-born with greatness, subject to the breath\nOf every fool whose sense no more can feel\nBut his own wringing.

O, be sick, great greatness,\nAnd bid thy ceremony give thee cure!\nThink'st thou the fiery fever will go out\nWith titles blown from adulation?\nWill it give place to flexure and low bending?\nCanst thou, when thou command'st the beggar's\nknee,\nCommand the health of it?

Or if I might buffet for my love, or bound my\nhorse for her favors, I could lay on like a butcher\nand sit like a jackanapes, never off. But, before God,\nKate, I cannot look greenly nor gasp out my eloquence,\nnor I have no cunning in protestation, only\ndownright oaths, which I never use till urged, nor\nnever break for urging. If thou canst love a fellow of\nthis temper, Kate, whose face is not worth sun-burning,\nthat never looks in his glass for love of\nanything he sees there, let thine eye be thy cook. I\nspeak to thee plain soldier. If thou canst love me for\nthis, take me. If not, to say to thee that I shall die is\ntrue, but for thy love, by the Lord, no. Yet I love thee\ntoo. And while thou liv'st, dear Kate, take a fellow of\nplain and uncoined constancy, for he perforce must\ndo thee right because he hath not the gift to woo in\nother places. For these fellows of infinite tongue,\nthat can rhyme themselves into ladies' favors, they\ndo always reason themselves out again. What? A\nspeaker is but a prater, a rhyme is but a ballad, a\ngood leg will fall, a straight back will stoop, a black\nbeard will turn white, a curled pate will grow bald,\na fair face will wither, a full eye will wax hollow, but\na good heart, Kate, is the sun and the moon, or\nrather the sun and not the moon, for it shines bright\nand never changes but keeps his course truly. If\nthou would have such a one, take me. And take me,\ntake a soldier. Take a soldier, take a king. And what\nsay'st thou then to my love? Speak, my fair, and\nfairly, I pray thee.\nKATHERINE  Is it possible dat I sould love de enemy of\nFrance?\nKING HENRY  No, it is not possible you should love the\nenemy of France, Kate. But, in loving me, you\nshould love the friend of France, for I love France\nso well that I will not part with a village of it. I will\nhave it all mine. And, Kate, when France is mine\nand I am yours, then yours is France and you are\nmine.\nKATHERINE  I cannot tell wat is dat.\nKING HENRY  No, Kate? I will tell thee in French,\nwhich I am sure will hang upon my tongue like a\nnew-married wife about her husband's neck, hardly\nto be shook off. Je quand sur le possession de\nFrance, et quand vous avez le possession de moi--let\nme see, what then? Saint Denis be my speed!--donc\nvotre est France, et vous etes mienne. It is as easy for\nme, Kate, to conquer the kingdom as to speak so\nmuch more French. I shall never move thee in\nFrench, unless it be to laugh at me.\nKATHERINE  Sauf votre honneur, le francais que vous\nparlez, il est meilleur que l'anglais lequel je parle.\nKING HENRY  No, faith, is 't not, Kate, but thy speaking\nof my tongue, and I thine, most truly-falsely must\nneeds be granted to be much at one. But, Kate, dost\nthou understand thus much English? Canst thou\nlove me?\nKATHERINE  I cannot tell.\nKING HENRY  Can any of your neighbors tell, Kate? I'll\nask them. Come, I know thou lovest me; and at\nnight, when you come into your closet, you'll question\nthis gentlewoman about me, and, I know, Kate,\nyou will, to her, dispraise those parts in me that you\nlove with your heart. But, good Kate, mock me\nmercifully, the rather, gentle princess, because I\nlove thee cruelly. If ever thou beest mine, Kate, as I\nhave a saving faith within me tells me thou shalt, I\nget thee with scambling, and thou must therefore\nneeds prove a good soldier-breeder. Shall not thou\nand I, between Saint Denis and Saint George, compound\na boy, half French, half English, that shall go\nto Constantinople and take the Turk by the beard?\nShall we not? What say'st thou, my fair flower de\nluce?\nKATHERINE  I do not know dat.\nKING HENRY  No, 'tis hereafter to know, but now to\npromise. Do but now promise, Kate, you will\nendeavor for your French part of such a boy; and\nfor my English moiety, take the word of a king and\na bachelor. How answer you, la plus belle Katherine\ndu monde, mon tres cher et divin deesse?\nKATHERINE  Your Majeste 'ave fausse French enough to\ndeceive de most sage demoiselle dat is en France.\nKING HENRY  Now fie upon my false French. By mine\nhonor, in true English, I love thee, Kate. By which\nhonor I dare not swear thou lovest me, yet my blood\nbegins to flatter me that thou dost, notwithstanding\nthe poor and untempering effect of my visage. Now\nbeshrew my father's ambition! He was thinking of\ncivil wars when he got me; therefore was I created\nwith a stubborn outside, with an aspect of iron, that\nwhen I come to woo ladies, I fright them. But, in\nfaith, Kate, the elder I wax, the better I shall appear.\nMy comfort is that old age, that ill layer-up of\nbeauty, can do no more spoil upon my face. Thou\nhast me, if thou hast me, at the worst, and thou shalt\nwear me, if thou wear me, better and better. And\ntherefore tell me, most fair Katherine, will you have\nme? Put off your maiden blushes, avouch the\nthoughts of your heart with the looks of an empress,\ntake me by the hand, and say \"Harry of England, I\nam thine,\" which word thou shalt no sooner bless\nmine ear withal, but I will tell thee aloud \"England\nis thine, Ireland is thine, France is thine, and Henry\nPlantagenet is thine,\" who, though I speak it before\nhis face, if he be not fellow with the best king, thou\nshalt find the best king of good fellows. Come, your\nanswer in broken music, for thy voice is music, and\nthy English broken. Therefore, queen of all, Katherine,\nbreak thy mind to me in broken English. Wilt\nthou have me?\nKATHERINE  Dat is as it shall please de roi mon pere.\nKING HENRY  Nay, it will please him well, Kate; it shall\nplease him, Kate.\nKATHERINE  Den it sall also content me.\nKING HENRY  Upon that I kiss your hand, and I call you\nmy queen.\nKATHERINE  Laissez, mon seigneur, laissez, laissez! Ma\nfoi, je ne veux point que vous abaissiez votre grandeur,\nen baisant la main d' une--Notre Seigneur!--\nindigne serviteur. Excusez-moi, je vous supplie, mon\ntres puissant seigneur.\nKING HENRY  Then I will kiss your lips, Kate.\nKATHERINE  Les dames et demoiselles, pour etre baisees\ndevant leurs noces, il n'est pas la coutume de France.\nKING HENRY  Madam my interpreter, what says she?\nALICE  Dat it is not be de fashion pour les ladies of\nFrance--I cannot tell wat is baiser en Anglish.\nKING HENRY  To kiss.\nALICE  Your Majeste entendre bettre que moi.\nKING HENRY  It is not a fashion for the maids in France\nto kiss before they are married, would she say?\nALICE  Oui, vraiment.\nKING HENRY  O Kate, nice customs curtsy to great\nkings. Dear Kate, you and I cannot be confined\nwithin the weak list of a country's fashion. We are\nthe makers of manners, Kate, and the liberty that\nfollows our places stops the mouth of all find-faults,\nas I will do yours for upholding the nice fashion of\nyour country in denying me a kiss. Therefore,\npatiently and yielding. [He kisses her.] You have\nwitchcraft in your lips, Kate. There is more eloquence\nin a sugar touch of them than in the tongues\nof the French council, and they should sooner\npersuade Harry of England than a general petition\nof monarchs.\n[Enter the French power, the French King and Queen\nand Burgundy, and the English Lords Westmoreland\nand Exeter.]\nHere comes your father.\nBURGUNDY  God save your Majesty. My royal cousin,\nteach you our princess English?\nKING HENRY  I would have her learn, my fair cousin,\nhow perfectly I love her, and that is good English.\nBURGUNDY  Is she not apt?\nKING HENRY  Our tongue is rough, coz, and my condition\nis not smooth, so that, having neither the voice\nnor the heart of flattery about me, I cannot so\nconjure up the spirit of love in her that he will\nappear in his true likeness.\nBURGUNDY  Pardon the frankness of my mirth if I\nanswer you for that. If you would conjure in her,\nyou must make a circle; if conjure up Love in her in\nhis true likeness, he must appear naked and blind.\nCan you blame her, then, being a maid yet rosed\nover with the virgin crimson of modesty, if she deny\nthe appearance of a naked blind boy in her naked\nseeing self? It were, my lord, a hard condition for a\nmaid to consign to.\nKING HENRY  Yet they do wink and yield, as love is\nblind and enforces.\nBURGUNDY  They are then excused, my lord, when they\nsee not what they do.\nKING HENRY  Then, good my lord, teach your cousin to\nconsent winking.\nBURGUNDY  I will wink on her to consent, my lord, if\nyou will teach her to know my meaning, for maids\nwell summered and warm kept are like flies at\nBartholomew-tide: blind, though they have their\neyes; and then they will endure handling, which\nbefore would not abide looking on.\nKING HENRY  This moral ties me over to time and a hot\nsummer. And so I shall catch the fly, your cousin,\nin the latter end, and she must be blind too.\nBURGUNDY  As love is, my lord, before it loves.\nKING HENRY  It is so. And you may, some of you, thank\nlove for my blindness, who cannot see many a fair\nFrench city for one fair French maid that stands in\nmy way.\nKING OF FRANCE  Yes, my lord, you see them perspectively,\nthe cities turned into a maid, for they are all\ngirdled with maiden walls that war hath never\nentered.\nKING HENRY  Shall Kate be my wife?\nKING OF FRANCE  So please you.\nKING HENRY  I am content, so the maiden cities you\ntalk of may wait on her. So the maid that stood in\nthe way for my wish shall show me the way to my\nwill.",
